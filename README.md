Source code to Jeopardy 2.0 - C#/WPF Rewrite

Here is the source code to Jeopardy 2.0, the 2019 WPF Rewrite to follow up the original VB.NET version. Now in High Definition!

You will need:
- PC with two displays, second monitor set to 1920x1080 with DPI scaling off (or set to 100% in Win10/11)
- Visual Studio 2019 (I had some weird glitches with VS2022 I haven't yet figured out)

An example game file is located in Debug\data\MP 2023.jep; it's just a renamed XML file and should be pretty easy to parse.

You will need the following fonts which are not included for copyright reasons:

- Helvetica LT Compressed
- Korinna BT Bold
- Swiss911 UT
